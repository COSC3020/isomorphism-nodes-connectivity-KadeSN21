# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

In a completely connected graph, all verticies are connected to eachother by an edge. For example, if we have a graph $G1$ with verticies $x,y,z,w$ the graph contains the edges $(x,y), (x,z), (x,w), (y,z), (y,w), (z,w)$ In order to prove that another completely connected graoh with the same number of nodes as $G1$ is isomorphic to $G1$, we need to find a "one-to-one" relationship between them, meaning that for every vertex in $G1$ with , there is a vertex in $G2$
